## Lessons Learned

- **Passing Parameters via URL and Nested Routes in React Router:** This allows you to create more dynamic and complex routes, enhancing the navigation of your application.
- **Typing Parameters:** Correctly typing function parameters in TypeScript helps to prevent errors and makes the code easier to maintain.
- **Using Contexts:** Contexts in React allow you to share data between components without passing props manually through every intermediate level, simplifying the management of global state.
